# linear_regression
Linear Regression is a predictive modelling technique that establishes a relationship
between dependent variable (Y) and one or more explanatory variables denoted by X, using a best
fit straight line (also known as regression line).
It is represented by the equation, 𝑌 = 𝑎 + 𝑏 ∗ 𝑋 + 𝑒, where a is intercept, b is slope of the line and e
is error term.
This equation can be used to predict the value of target variable based on given predictor variable(s).
The case of one explanatory variable is called simple linear regression. For more than one
explanatory variables, the process is called multiple linear regression. In this technique, the
dependent variable is continuous, independent variable(s) can be continuous or discrete, and nature
of the regression line is linear.
